    " - [ ] add percentage change columns to normalize data, only challenge is counties with small populations could have a large percentage but not be as news worthy\n",

    " - [ ] pull data directly from usafacts \n",
    " - [ ] Allow run in COLAB and save to Google Drive\n",

    "## Done\n",
    " - [x] x day rolling averages\n",
    " - [x] ensure proper data types in df_combined_tidy\n",
    " - [x] make tidy data one row per observation (observations are by date)\n",
